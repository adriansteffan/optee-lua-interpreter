Kudos to peter [Peter Feifan Chen](https://github.com/peterfeifanchen) for providing the modified version of the lua interpreter that is able to run in a trusted application. 
The code can be found in the ```lua``` directory.

The project structure is based on the [hello_world_example](https://github.com/linaro-swg/optee_examples/tree/master/hello_world) by [Linaro](https://github.com/linaro-swg).
